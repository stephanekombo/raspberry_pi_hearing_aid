    TODO: implement a GUI, write docstring

    Written by StÃ©phane Kombo (stephane.kombo.pro@gmail.com)
    Largely based on the work of Stefan Bleeck and the 2018 GDP Group 16 - University of Southampton

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_buffer: ndarray
        Shape: (sample_factor * buffer_length, )
    prev_input_buffer: ndarray
        Shape: (buffer_length, )
    prev_output_buffer: ndarray
        Shape: (buffer_length, )
    octave_bands: ndarray
        Shape: (nbands, )
    f_sample: int
        For now, ALSA seems to impose 48000 Hz. We want 32000 Hz.
    sample_factor: int
        Factor to use in order to have a 16 KHz in the signal processors.
        sample_factor is 3 if f_sample is 48 KHz, sample_factor is 2 if f_sample is 32 KHz
        Should correspond to the nperiods ALSA parameter. TODO: confirm
    f_shift: int

        Need to be a power of 2 for JACK.
